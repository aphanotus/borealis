includes a column with scale values.}

\item{invert.scale}{A logical value indicating whether to invert the scale value.}

\item{export.metadata}{A logical value indicating whether or not metadata should be
exported to a separate file.}

\item{include.header}{A logical value indicating whether to include a header in the
TPS file containing data provenance. Setting the value to \code{FALSE} will
produce a TPS file suitable for \href{https://morphometrics.uk/MorphoJ_page.html}{MorphoJ}.}

\description{
Reformats coordinate positions from a \code{csv} or \code{xlsx} spreadsheet into the \code{tps} ("thin-plate spline")
file format defined by Rohlf (2015).
}
\details{
The first row of the input file must provide column names.
There must be columns headed "x" and "y", although these are not case-sensitive
and can occur in any order.
There must be a column giving specimen IDs, using a name like "ID" or "specimen_IDs"
Any other columns are optional and may be used to encode metadata.
Columns named by \code{id.factors} will be added to the \code{ID=} line
in the resulting \code{tps} file, separated by the character string in the \code{separator} parameter.
\code{create.tps} is also compatible with 3D data (recognized by a column named "z").
However other \code{borealis} functions, including \code{read.tps} are not currently prepared to
handle 3D coordinates.

If \code{include.scale = TRUE}, then you must
have a column headed "scale" to be included as a \code{SCALE=} line for each specimen in
the \code{tps} file.

The scale value can also be inverted, by setting \code{invert.scale = TRUE}.
This may be useful, because \code{\link[geomorph]{readland.tps}} applies scale values by multiplication.
Typically this is appropriate when scale is recorded as unit distance (e.g. mm) per pixel.
However, if scale is recorded in pixels per unit distance (e.g. pixels/mm)
it will be appropriate to first invert the scaling factor before importing coordinate data.
Replicate scale measurements for each specimen can be included in the scale column and will be averaged (mean).
(The number of scale measurements must not exceed the number of landmarks.)

Each row must include X and Y coordinates for landmarks, in order.
Each specimen should appear with a consecutive block of rows, with landmarks in the same order.
The number of landmarks must be consistent for all specimens. Specimen metadata must appear on the
first row for each specimen. (That is, on the row for landmark 1.)

By default, the number of specimens and landmarks will be determined by the function. This will be done
by using the number of cells in the specimen ID column with non-whitespace characters. It will be assumed
that all other metadata appears in the same rows, and any information in other rows will be ignored.

The \code{output.filename} may be specified, or by default it will be the input filename with the
addition of \code{.YYMMDD.tps}, where \code{YYMMDD} is the date.

If \code{export.metadata = TRUE} then a seperate output file will be created that contains only the metadata.
All metadata will be included in this file.

Only the first sheet will be used from \code{xlsx} input files.

# As an example, an input CSV file might looks like this:

# T330.5      , DRA       , control   , adult , 1.23  , f   , 320 , 453
#             ,           ,           ,       ,       ,     , 303 , 468
#             ,           ,           ,       ,       ,     , 289 , 447
# T330.6      , DRA       , control   , adult , 1.24  , m   , 319 , 490
